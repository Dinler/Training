## Google Colab

Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.

```{r colab_logo, echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics('/home/andrefonseca/Training/HLA-Arena/Training/figures/colab_logo.jpeg')

```

## Why should I use it?

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
